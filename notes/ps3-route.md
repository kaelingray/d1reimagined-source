# PS3 / RPCS3 comparison track

Started 2026-09-24 at the user's request. The user added a PS3 Destiny ISO under the workspace. The ISO is excluded from Git, as are both game-image folders. It mounts read-only as a UDF volume labelled `DESTINYTHEGAME` and contains `PS3_GAME/PARAM.SFO`, `PS3_GAME/USRDIR/EBOOT.BIN`, and a disc firmware update. A working copy with 257 files (7,927,290,856 bytes) was prepared outside Git under `D:\Destiny360\01_WORKING\ps3_destiny`; the source ISO remains unchanged. Robocopy reported zero failures and excluded the firmware file, which was copied separately.

The official RPCS3 Windows build `v0.0.42-20043-b5a174e9` was downloaded from the [RPCS3 binary release](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3-binaries-win/releases/tag/build-b5a174e933a083389e2f851005e474ccb3e676d9). Its archive matched the adjacent publisher SHA-256 file (`D188BBD3C1D89F060E37376ABF7DE6B2B68379F68DD6B4DA1CD7B4AF75E31273`). It is extracted at `D:\Destiny360\TOOLS\RPCS3\rpcs3-v0.0.42-20043`. Sony's [official firmware page](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps3/system-software/) lists PS3 firmware 4.93. Its linked update host produced a certificate-name mismatch in this environment, so no HTTPS validation was bypassed. The PS3 ISO includes a `PS3_UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP` (268,435,456 bytes), copied privately to `D:\Destiny360\TOOLS\RPCS3\PS3UPDAT-from-disc.PUP` (SHA-256 `C52A0D8C0F4D9FDFE2C488C89EE3E509ECB3C84ABA8288A7A3ED65497F60D051`). That disc firmware may be older than 4.93. RPCS3's firmware installer populated `dev_flash` with 1,064 files. A first launch of the working `EBOOT.BIN` opened a game window identified as Destiny `BLES01857`; the visible in-game result is pending.

This route has relevant precedent: an [RPCS3 issue for Destiny BLES01857](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/12802) reports reaching character selection with private servers in a modified build, although it also documents a graphics crash. The [RPCN compatibility list](https://wiki.rpcs3.net/index.php?title=RPCN_Compatibility_List) lists Destiny as unavailable through generic RPCN and says private servers are required. [cohaereo/rpcs3-v4nguard](https://github.com/cohaereo/rpcs3-v4nguard) is a Destiny-focused RPCS3 fork, but its latest listed prerelease and repository activity are from September 2022. It is an older research lead rather than a current drop-in fix. These sources establish that modified RPCS3 and private servers have been used for Destiny; they do not establish a public, working Destiny backend or a playable result on this machine.

The first visible screen said "Precompiling shader interpreter variants" and began building 6,650 base variants. RPCS3 remained responsive while this ran. It then reached Destiny's "Press X to Play" title screen. The logo and background looked intact in the user's screenshot. RPCS3's Player 1 handler initially defaulted to Keyboard; changing it to XInput detected the user's Xbox controller as "XInput Pad #1", with A mapped to PlayStation Cross. Pressing A displayed Destiny's **canary** error: "No internet connection detected." RPCS3 listed the disc as version 01.00 and an available update as 01.24; the update was not installed for this baseline test.

In a second run, the same official RPCS3 installation was changed only from Network Status **Disconnected** to **Connected**, leaving PSN Status **Disconnected**. Pressing A then advanced from canary to **buffalo**: "You must be signed into PSN in order to play Destiny." This isolates a passed network-status check and a new PSN sign-in gate. The current RPCS3 UI lists only **Disconnected** and **RPCN** under PSN Status; it has no local simulated sign-in choice. No RPCN account was created or connected during these tests.

After RPCS3 closed normally, its private log recorded both run configurations: `Internet enabled: Disconnected` / `PSN status: Disconnected` for the first run and `Internet enabled: Connected` / `PSN status: Disconnected` for the second. The second run initialized `sceNp` and attempted a UDP bind on port 1001. Repeated `ENOTCONN` socket messages appeared later while the game was at the error screen. Those messages do not establish the cause of buffalo; the on-screen text explicitly names the missing PSN sign-in. The full log remains outside Git at `D:\Destiny360\TOOLS\RPCS3\rpcs3-v0.0.42-20043\log\RPCS3.log`.

The fork's August 2022 commit [`1f065d3`](https://github.com/cohaereo/rpcs3-v4nguard/commit/1f065d3) adds a `sys_net_bnet_sendmsg` implementation and Destiny-specific texture-cache crash workarounds. Its September 2022 commit [`08e2b9d`](https://github.com/cohaereo/rpcs3-v4nguard/commit/08e2b9d) disables some verification failures and changes graphics code. Those changes target later network and rendering failures; the fork does not document a bundled Destiny service. The modern official build already renders the title correctly, so an old fork binary is not the next useful diagnostic until a compatible backend or post-login failure is available.

A local RPCN server (see `notes/test-log.md`, PS3 comparison 003) cleared buffalo. Destiny then requested an NP ticket for service `UP0002-BLUS31181_00` and tried Demonware/Bungie HTTPS sign-on hosts (`www*.signon.deadorbit.net`, `www*.signon.gravityshavings.net`), ending at "Destiny servers are not available." The public V4NGUARD custom-server project demonstrated Destiny on RPCS3 reaching the Tower but has not published its server.

Next: determine whether a usable Destiny PS3 service endpoint exists and what RPCN/PSN sign-in it requires. Only then test authentication or later gameplay in a separate RPCS3 installation. Do not push the ISO, firmware, extracted game, emulator binary, save data, or raw network traces.

## Local service stand-ins (2026-09-24, comparisons 004–013)

A loopback-only toolset in `server/` now replaces each gate the game hits before sign-on, and keeps every name the game resolves on this PC (`server/README.md`):

1. **DNS** — `dns_sinkhole.py`, set as RPCS3's DNS address, answers everything locally.
2. **Demonware STUN / NAT discovery** — the game probes `dev-stun.demonware.net:3074` from its own UDP port 3074. With no answer it shows **marionberry**. `stun_stub.py` answers IP discovery (type 30 → 31) and NAT discovery (20 → 21) using the layout in [project-bo4/shield-development `stun_server.cpp`](https://github.com/project-bo4/shield-development/blob/6b8f7ce/source/proxy-dll/demonware/servers/stun_server.cpp) (GPL-3.0; format reference only, no code copied). Destiny accepts it and moves on. The stub runs on 127.0.0.2 because RPCS3 holds the game's `0.0.0.0:3074`.
3. **PSN sign-in** — loopback RPCN, as in comparison 003.
4. **HTTPS sign-on** — the client offers only SSL 3.0 (3DES/RC4/DES/export suites, no SNI). `sslv3.py` implements the server side; `signon_probe.py` gives each sign-on hostname its own loopback address so the right certificate is chosen without SNI.

**Current blocker: certificate trust.** Destiny loads only firmware roots `CA01`–`CA05` (SCEI DNAS Root 01–05; LF-terminated PEM, PrintableString C/O/CN, SHA-1, 2048-bit). The firmware `libssl.sprx` loader reads a replacement root and stops, whatever slot it occupies; the game then hits a fatal-error path (`0x0010723c`, `r23 = "ps3_ppu"`) while preparing the sign-on URL. Matching line endings, subject structure, string types, extensions and validity dates did not help. RPCS3's HLE `cellSslCertificateLoader` (in `rpcs3/Emu/Cell/Modules/cellSsl.cpp`) simply concatenates files, but this game uses the LLE module.

Next options, most promising first:

- Find the rejecting check in the decrypted LLE `libssl.sprx` (RPCS3 can decrypt firmware modules) and apply an RPCS3 patch in the isolated copy so the loader accepts a local root.
- Leave the DNAS roots intact and instead patch the game's HTTPS verification (it imports `cellHttpClientSetSslCallback` and `cellSslCertGet*`), so any chain is accepted for the sign-on hosts only.
- Try RPCS3's HLE `libssl` for the loader only — unlikely to work, because the LLE `libhttp` depends on the real SSL implementation.

Once the handshake completes, `signon_probe.py` will save the first sign-on request under `D:\Destiny360\SIGNON_LOCAL\captures` for protocol work.

## Sign-on reached (2026-09-24, comparison 014)

The certificate blocker was in the game, not the firmware. Destiny passes `cellHttpsInit` two CA buffers: firmware CA01–CA05, and a PEM string built into the EBOOT (`0x011b7218`) that holds Bungie's own "Tiger Root Authority" and GeoTrust Global CA. Replacing firmware roots broke the first buffer and crashed the game. Leaving those roots alone and patching the embedded string in guest memory with the local CA (`server/game_ca_patch.py`, an RPCS3 patch) keeps every verification step on and lets the SSLv3 handshake complete.

The game now sends its first sign-on request to the local probe: `POST /SignOn?platform=ps3_ppu&build=41375.14.07.03.1501.live`, a 390-byte protobuf body that wraps the NP ticket with language, build and region fields (`notes/test-log.md`, comparison 014).

A fallback exists if a later host needs it: the SSL callback's return at `0x108224` (`extsw r3, r27`) could return 0 and accept any chain. That fallback is not needed now.

The `SignOn` exchange uses nanopb 0.1.x messages. Their field tables are compiled into the EBOOT, so `server/signon_proto.py` documents both messages. A local success reply was accepted in comparison 015. The game then moved on to Demonware authentication (`POST /auth/` on `panther-ps3-auth3.prod.demonware.net`), which is the current gate.

## Demonware auth3 request (comparison 015 captures)

After the local SignOn reply, the client looks up `panther-ps3-auth3.prod.demonware.net` (the EBOOT also names `lobby`, `auth` and `auth3` hosts for the `prod`, `cert` and `dev` environments; all nine now resolve to `127.0.3.1`–`9`). It sends one request per attempt over the same SSLv3 client as SignOn:

- `POST /auth/`, `Content-Type: application/json`, `X-TransactionID: 0`, about 490 bytes. The URL is built from the format string `%s://%s:%d/auth/`.
- Body: a flat JSON object whose values are all **strings**, even the numeric ones:
  - `auth_task`: `"18"` in every attempt.
  - `title_id`: `"5378"` in every attempt.
  - `iv_seed`: a decimal 32-bit value that changes on every attempt.
  - `extra_data`: a JSON document encoded as a string, `{"token": "<base64>"}`. The token decodes to the same 294-byte NP ticket that the SignOn body carries (version 2.1, issued by the local RPCN for `d1localtest`, service `UP0002-BLUS31181_00`).
- When the reply is 503, the client resends: five requests in all, arriving at about 0, 0.1, 1.2, 3.3 and 7.4 s. No further request was captured, and the screen stays on "SIGNING IN".

The request-side strings sit together in the EBOOT near `0x12ca360` (`auth_task`, `iv_seed`, `title_id`, `extra_data`, the URL format, `application/json`). The client classes are named `bdAuth`, `bdAuthPS3` and `bdAuthService`. The raw requests are kept privately in `D:\Destiny360\SIGNON_LOCAL\captures`.

## Auth3 accepted (comparison 016)

`server/auth3_proto.py` implements a synthetic local reply, enabled with `signon_probe.py --mode auth3`. Request task 18 expects **response task 19**, with `code=700` and the request's `iv_seed`. All three are emitted as decimal strings. Inspection of `0xa2c7a8` shows the JSON integer reader accepts both string and numeric nodes (types 1 and 2); the string constructor at `0xa2d954` writes type 1. The PS3 handler at `0xa264f8` supplies expected task 19 and decoded size 145 to the generic handler at `0xa24b94`.

The tickets are base64-encoded plaintext at this stage. Client ticket = packed 128-byte `bdAuthTicket` followed by 17 bytes of PS3 information; server ticket = opaque 128-byte local token. The key and token are generated per reply and kept together outside Git for later lobby work. No real PSN identity is validated by this diagnostic responder.

Important layout distinction from `0xa2c1dc`: the **wire** ticket has no native alignment padding. Its format is `<IBIIIQQ64s24s3s4s`: magic `0xEFBDADDE`, type, title, issue/expiry timestamps, license/user IDs, name, session key, reserved bytes, hash. The session key is 24 bytes at **wire offset 0x61**, copied to **object offset 0x68**. The PS3 extension starts at wire offset 128; two u32s and three byte flags are consumed. Their semantics and the remaining padding are still unverified; this test used zeros.

At 15:10 on 2026-09-24, an isolated `D:\Destiny360\RPCS3_TEST016_AUTH3` copy completed local SignOn and received one successful auth3 reply. It then resolved the lobby to `127.0.3.1` and connected to TCP 3074. The listener received 28 bytes: five little-endian u32 values `200, 200, 210, 210, 65535`, followed by eight changing bytes. With no lobby response, it disconnected about 9.5 seconds later and showed **cattle**, "Lost connection to partner services." This demonstrates acceptance of auth3 and entry into lobby negotiation, not completion of lobby authentication or gameplay.

Evidence: private `SIGNON_LOCAL/logs/test016-{probe,dns,lobby}.log`, request/session files in `SIGNON_LOCAL/captures`, and the lobby binary capture. The synthetic HTTP integration test preceded the game attempt and is distinguishable by its 56-byte request on port 80; the actual game request was 491 bytes over SSLv3 on port 443. Two wire-contract tests also passed, including invalid task/title/seed rejection.

## Lobby authentication accepted (comparisons 017–018)

Comparison 017b answered the lobby greeting with `server_header_ack` (`lobby_probe.py`). The client replied with a 153-byte `client_auth` frame, then timed out with **cattle** because the probe stayed silent. The client code at `0xa3ad10`/`0xa3af98` (BLES01857 01.00) shows the full exchange, and the 017b capture reproduces it byte for byte:

- **Framing.** Each frame is a u32le length followed by the body. A first body byte of 1 or 2 marks an encrypted frame. Any other value, such as `AB`, is plaintext with a 1-byte header followed by the message type. The receive limit is the greeting's fifth u32 (65535).
- **`client_auth` (`AB 82`).** The body is an LSB-first `bdBitBuffer`: header byte `0x07`, a few type/flag bits, title ID 5378 as a u32 at bit 14, the auth3 `iv_seed` as a u32 at bit 51, the 128-byte auth3 server ticket at bit 83, and 5 padding bits. An 8-byte challenge follows. Because the ticket is bit-packed, a byte search does not find it.
- **Key derivation.** The transcript is the greeting minus its two 200 markers, the whole `server_header_ack` frame, and the `client_auth` frame without its challenge. Then `H = SHA1(transcript)`, `PRK = HMAC-SHA1(key=H, msg=24-byte auth3 session key)`, and `HKDF-Expand(PRK, "CLIENTCHAL", 16)`. The KDF at `0xa37308` is RFC 5869 expand with HMAC-SHA1, confirmed against RFC test case 4. Bytes 0–7 are the challenge the client sends. Bytes 8–15 go to connection object +0x1f0.
- **`server_auth_done` (`AB 83`).** The 8-byte payload must equal the saved bytes 8–15. `0xa3a4e0` compares them. A mismatch logs "Server replied with an invalid verify"; a match logs "Completed authentication procedure. Connected to MatchMaking" and sets the connection to READY. The frame is `0a000000 ab 83 <verify>`.
- **Frame keys.** `HKDF-Expand(PRK, "BDDATA", 72)` produces two 20-byte values (object +0x200 and +0x214) and two 16-byte keys for the two cipher objects (+0x1f8 and +0x1fc). Their roles, presumably MAC and cipher keys for the two directions, are not yet traced.

`lobby_probe.py` now selects the auth3 session by proof: the session key must reproduce the client's challenge. It then sends `server_auth_done` and saves the derived values privately beside the capture (`lobby-keys.json`, outside Git).

**Comparison 018** (`D:\Destiny360\RPCS3_TEST018_LOBBY_AUTH`, a copy of 017) changed only the lobby probe. SignOn, auth3, greeting and `client_auth` ran as in 017b. The probe verified the challenge and sent `server_auth_done`. The RPCS3 trace shows the client reading all 10 bytes, then waiting for the next frame header, which is consistent with the READY path. About 70 ms later a game job thread closed the socket. The client made no further DNS lookups or connections. The in-emulator screenshot shows a new error, **termite**: "Failed to download configuration files from Bungie servers, please try again." Cattle no longer appears.

Leads for termite (not yet confirmed):

- The SignOn handler (`0x126744`) stores optional response fields in the sign-on singleton at `0x18a44f8`. A debug routine at `0xb6ba4c` labels two of them: field 5 (u64, +0x41f0) is `silo_id`, and field 6 (string[64], +0x4204) is `signon_server_reported_content_version` ("none reported" when absent). Field 4 is `{1 u64 → +0x4460, 2 u32 → +0x4468, 3 bytes}`. Its bytes are decoded by the callback `0x126fec` → `0x1214e8` using a large configuration message with built-in defaults (descriptor `0x11c7677`). The local SignOn reply leaves fields 4, 5 and 6 unset.
- The executable's error-ID table (`0x175eaf8`, 242 entries) includes `error.content_manifest_not_provided` (100), `content_manifest_url_invalid` (101), `no_cdn_connection` (98) and `bungie_server_connection` (96). The name-to-code mapping for termite has not been found; the display text lives outside the EBOOT.
- A `stat` of `/dev_hdd1/downloads/` (ENOENT) ran just before the close. The nearby strings are DLC-related (`offer_key.edat`, "DLC Data"), so it is probably a side effect.

## Content manifest and packages (comparisons 019–022)

The termite leads were right: the bootflow's content-manifest step (`0x32bb40`) reads the manifest URL through `0xb6ca90`, which returns the title configuration's string at +0x1004. That configuration comes from **SignOn response field 4**: `{1 u64, 2 u32, 3 bytes}`. The bytes are decoded by the callback `0x126fec` → `0x1214e8` using descriptor `0x11c7677`, a 58-submessage title configuration. Its field 1 holds the content manifest: `{1 bytes[4096], 2 URL string[256], 3 GUID string[37], 4 string[128]}`. This nanopb decoder skips the required-field check for submessages and for fields with defaults (`0xb1afc0`), so a configuration containing only field 1 is accepted. `server/signon_proto.py` documents the layout.

- **019.** The SignOn reply's configuration held only `http://content.local.test/manifest` and a GUID. Right after lobby auth, the game resolved the host and sent `GET /manifest` (libhttp, plain HTTP). The probe answered 503, and the error changed from termite to **nightingale** (same message).
- **Manifest format** (`0xb6f338`). A data flag at `0x0179d5f4` (initially 1, read only at `0xb6f3cc`) requires a 0x108-byte header: u32le 1, u32le 0, and a 256-byte RSA signature. `0xb23b34` (libtomcrypt) checks it against a runtime key table at `0x01871c70`; failure gives "signature failure". The rest is a nanopb message (`0x12a2e7d`) decoded into a 0x4e440-byte struct. Field 5 is the GUID, and the bootflow requires it to match the configuration's GUID. The status names are at `0x129fd74`: bad account state, decode failure, download failure, duplicate offer keys, guid mismatch, insufficient download size, signature failure, url not provided, bad url (404).
- **020.** An RPCS3 patch (`game_ca_patch.py --unsigned-manifest`) clears the signature flag in guest memory, and the probe serves a manifest containing only the GUID. The download was accepted and the lobby connection stayed open. The game then halted with "The game disc cannot be read." The halt handler (`0x6937d0`, "release_vhalt") shows that text for fatal halts; the halt reason, read from guest buffer `0x1986228`, was **"failed to load bootstrap_patchable"**.
- **Package registration** (`0x32d450`). The bootflow registers every manifest field-3 entry `{1 offer ref, 2 name, 3 package id (10–6143), 4 u64}` through `0x324efc`. The package group names (`0x11f86b8`) include `client_bootstrap_patchable`. A bare name resolves to `packages/<name>.pkg` on the disc (`0xe5940`).
- **021.** The manifest listed the 160 disc packages (language-neutral packages plus the English variant of each localized id; the id is taken from the file name). Every package was opened, then the game halted with "Patchable package registration failed with result (-90)". `0xe5c2c` compares the entry's field 4 with the u64 at offset 8 of the package header (big-endian; the header starts `0018 0004 <id> 0001`); a mismatch gives -90, and an id mismatch gives -91.
- **022.** Field 4 was set to each package's header value (only the first 16 bytes of each file are read). Registration succeeded with no halt. About 15 s later the game connected over TCP to the **session server address from the SignOn reply** (`127.1.1.127:12850`), for the first time. It sent 80 bytes: `01 02 | 00 4a | 00 19 | 00 00 00 00`, then protobuf `{1: <SignOn token, 64 bytes>, 2: 1}`. `session_listener.py` never replies, so the game closed after 10 s and showed **centipede**, "Your connection to Destiny servers has been lost."

The next gate is Bungie's own session protocol on that connection: framing `01 02`, a u16 length, and a u16 message type (0x19 here). The EBOOT's error names mention a `bap` connection and investment servers, so the next step is to find the handler for the reply to message 0x19. Both patches are loopback diagnostics: the CA patch keeps SSL verification on but trusts a private root, and the manifest patch disables one signature check.

## BAP session server (comparisons 023–026)

`server/bap_server.py` now answers the session server address from SignOn (`127.1.1.127:12850`). The protocol was read from the client code; the details and addresses are in the module's docstring.

- **Framing.** Each frame starts with u8 version 1, a u8 kind and a u32be length. Kind 2 is plaintext; kind 1 is encrypted. Client-to-server headers are `u16 type | u32 id`. Server replies use `u16 type | u32 id | u16 status`, and the status must be 200. Message names come from `0x7c6ef4`.
- **`shello` (0x19 → 0x1a).** The request is protobuf `{1 SignOn token, 2 mode, 3 u64, 4 bool}`. The reply is a sealed blob: `u32be N | IV | AES-128-CBC | HMAC-SHA256`, keyed with **SignOn session keys 2 (AES) and 3 (MAC)**. Its plaintext is `nonce[12] || session_key[16]`.
- **Encrypted frames.** After shello, frames are AES-128-GCM under that session key: 16-byte tag first, no AAD. Each direction has its own nonce: the client sends with the last nonce byte XOR 1. Nonces are incremented as little-endian counters.
- **023.** shello was accepted; the client then sent encrypted `qz_reg req` (0x79).
- **024.** `qz_reg rsp` (empty) was accepted; the client sent `rrc req` (0x12e) with its LAN and STUN addresses.
- **025.** `rrc rsp` and `echo rsp` (both empty) were accepted. The client sent `c->ws req` (0x0a), a web-service call for **service 503**. Its payload uses the engine's bit-packed type serializer and contains the RPCN name `d1localtest` and a u64. With no reply, the game timed out after about 10 s with **chicken**, "Your connection to Destiny character servers has been lost."
- **026.** A `c->ws rsp` containing the service id followed by 1024 zero bytes was read by the client (tag plus 1034 bytes). It still ended in chicken.

Next: service 503's response type. The service table is a runtime tag; each service record's request/response type handles are at +0xc and +0x10. The type-driven deserializer is `0x25e25c` → `0x25d2dc`.

## Investment sign-in (comparisons 027–027b)

`scripts/rpcs3_tiger_types.py` reads the engine's runtime type definitions and web-service table from a running test instance; its docstring records the formats. Service 503 is the **investment account sign-in**. Its request is `{name[36] u8, account_id u64}`. Its response (type `0x80801825`, 0xe0 bytes) starts with the shared result block `{u4 result, i32 detail}` (45 of 66 services use it), followed by a u64, two u32s and a struct of six optional fields: two u64s and counted lists of character-like records. Result codes (`0x41a2f8`): 0 error_none, 1 unknown, 2 no_content, 3 moved, 4 not_found, 5 service_unavailable, 6 unauthorized, 7 timeout.

- **026/027.** Result 0 (all other fields zero or absent) was accepted. The client sent nothing further and timed out after about 10 s with **chicken**.
- **027b.** Result 5 made the client disconnect within 100 ms and show **chimpanzee**, "There may be a problem with your Bungie account." This proves the reply is matched and decoded.

After a successful sign-in the client appears to wait for server pushes. The prime candidate is `qz->c update not` (0x7b, header kind 4), which carries investment "families": `[family_type, family_root_soid, version, flags, object_count]` followed by objects (decoder `0x4198d8`). The family types (`0xb6068c`) are peer, inspection, roster, select_character, self, universe, party_details and party_network_details. Next: the 0x7b frame layout and a minimal `self`/`select_character` push.

## Investment sign-in wait condition (comparisons 028–032, GDB)

RPCS3's GDB stub (`GDB Server: 127.0.0.1:2345` in `config.yml`) is enabled in the official build. `scripts/rpcs3_gdb.py` and `scripts/rpcs3_gdb_trace.py` set breakpoints and log the thread, registers and saved-LR chain on each hit. The stub pauses emulation on connect, so the tracer resumes it with `vCont;c`. Heavy tracing slows the game by about one second per hit.

- `0x3204a8` records bootflow milestones as well as errors. During sign-in it ran 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0xc, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13, and then chicken was raised as **(0x18, 0xa1) from `0x32d070`**.
- The investment sign-in bootflow step (`0x32cf44`) starts sign-in through `0x286fdc` (which posts event 0x22 via `0x262bc4`). It then polls until a timeout from title configuration +0x122c (10 000 ms, taken from the default configuration). Success needs: `0x294a54` == 0, **`0x294a5c` != 0**, `0x4249d8` != 0, a non-zero u64 from `0x2935c4`, and `0x28e5d4` != 0.
- GDB (031) showed the second check never passes. `0x294a5c` requires a user entry in the object at `*(0x18da7cc+4)`: byte state == 3, the 8-byte local player id at +1, and a non-zero u64 at +0x10. After the failure that entry was all zero.
- 028 (empty `self`/`select_character` family pushes) and 030 (sign-in reply carrying the request's account id, both optional u64s, and 1 in both u32s) did not change the outcome.

Next: follow event 0x22 through the investment update loop to find what sets the user entry to state 3, and whether it depends on 503 reply fields or on queuez family objects.

## Past sign-in: first-run setup screens (comparisons 033–048)

Destiny now passes the investment sign-in on the local stack and shows its first-run setup screens: **Set Screen Bounds → Adjust Brightness → Subtitles** (comparison 047, RPCS3 screenshots kept privately). The chain of fixes:

1. **Biased primitives.** The engine's serializer stores `value + min` for every primitive (readers at `0x175d5c8`, `decoded = bits - min`). The ws result enum has min 1 and a signed i32 has min 0x80000000. Replies sent as plain zeros decoded as result −1, which is why every earlier sign-in "success" was ignored.
2. **Sign-in reply** (service 503, handled by `0xbb8a40` → `0x295794`): result 0 moves the local user entry from state 2 to 3 and takes the user's root soid from response +0x08. The optional struct at +0x18 is the **universe object** (`0x41becc`); its first u64 must be the universe root `0x7fffffffffffffff` that the client subscribed to.
3. **Family fetch** (service 206, request `{u4 family type, u64 root}`): the reply is `{u4 result}` plus the ws **blob**, which carries a qz update payload for the family (a missing blob crashed the client at `0xbb882c`). The client fetches `select_character` (3) at the user's soid, then sends `sub req` (0x0c: `u8 family type, u64 root`) for `self` (4). The server answers `sub rsp` and pushes the family as a `qz->c update`.
4. **Objects.** An object is a header (u32 type hash, u64 soid, u32 payload length) plus a payload encoded with the object's runtime type. `server/investment.py` encodes any type from the exported schema. The sign-in step waits for the `self` root object (type hash `0x88190fe1`, id = soid; `0x293108`).
5. **Snapshots.** `0x41b75c` accepts a family for a new subscription only when flags bit 0 (full snapshot) is set; otherwise its objects are ignored.

GDB tracing through RPCS3's stub (`scripts/rpcs3_gdb*.py`) located each step: the error/milestone calls, the pending-request completion (`0x28c3b8`), the family/object manager (`0x41b75c`, `0x41b9ec`) and the sign-in reason codes (`0x28d4c0`: 2 = no subscription, 3 = unknown object type, 4 = no free object, 6 = version gap).

After the setup screens the client calls service 701 (1080-byte request). Unhandled services now receive their response type encoded by default (result error_none) from the exported schema.

## Character select to orbit (comparisons 049–062)

The game now reaches orbit on the local stack. Chain of fixes (details in `notes/test-log.md`):

1. **Stored character.** `bap_server.py --store` replays the created character in the select_character (3) and self (4) families at sign-in. `investment.py` array mode 1 is a fixed-capacity slot list: the nested type's first `count` fields are serialized (`0xd0f058`).
2. **Active character.** The character bootflow step (`0x32f748`, state query `0x325350` = 6) needs the user entry +0x20, which `0x2942fc` copies from the self root's u64 at +0x60 once `0x29305c` finds a self character object with that id. Service 504 (select) and 501 (create) now publish it in a versioned self delta.
3. **Reply order.** `0x7c3458` matches each reply against the oldest pending request (type and id). An unanswered request makes the next replies unmatched: connection failure reason 0x12, state 8, health condition 15, **centipede**. Failure names are at `0x122b000`; message descriptors are at runtime table `0x175fba8`.
4. **acct id trans (0x17/0x18).** Decoder `0x415764`: u16 count, u8 7, u8 0xff, the name entries (as in the request), then one u64 account id per entry.
5. **Service 104 and client config.** 104's reply embeds the universe object (root `0x7fffffffffffffff`, else **pig** 0xa2). `client config rsp` (0x13) is a nanopb message (`0x11d0bf0`: required uint64 1, required uint32 2).

RPCS3's GDB stub serves only one debugger connection per emulator session; `scripts/rpcs3_gdb_daemon.py` holds it and serves trace requests locally.
